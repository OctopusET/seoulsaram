# Writing a proposal for GSoC

## GSoC

GSoC is a something something:was:was

I applied for Xorg about writing new text input related protocol for wayland but unfortunately it was denied.

## VDD24

In November 2024, I helped organizing a conference; Video Dev Days by VideoLAN people. At that time I could meet lots of multimedia developers. I've been interested in RISC-V and low-level stuffs, but I couldn't get the motivation and hard to know where should I start. Even I had some RISC-V boards, I didn't do much things with that.

But at the conference, I could meet Nathan and other people and they mentioned that they might be able to mentor me and they also mentioned about the GSoC.

So I couldn't miss the chance.

## Writing a proposal

At first, I contacted to people on #dav1d IRC channel.
Nathan was willing to help me out, he explained the basics of what we need to do and he gave me the shell access permission for K230 device.

I wrote on proposal why I'm doing this project and what boards I have currently and the main goal of the project.

My main goal is implement the missing parts with VLEN==256bits and then maybe implement other parts with VLA so RISC-V devices with vector support with VLEN > 256bits can also get faster decoding speed.

I don't find fancy much on LLM or other 'AI' stuff that much, but it's helpful when you make a pretty document format or grammar check. With some help from them, and a lot of help from the Nathan. I could finish writing a proposal.
