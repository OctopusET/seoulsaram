# VDD24
VideoLan, an organisation developed VLC and another famous softwares organize a conference called video dev days everyyear.

Even I was long time uesr of softwares they support and develop but I haven't heard about that event before.

## Oneday...

In 2023, summer

a amzing developer Simon Ser posted a blog article about he is coming to Seoul, Korea. and He was willing to meet people.

I was long time user of sway and I once contacted with him because of GSOC so I couldn't miss the chance

I met him at Seoul and had a 부대찌개 together

we walked a lot, I think it was a bit hash walk even for the European haha

We talked a lot of things. and it was amazing experience. One thing we missed was taking a picture.

Almost a year later he contacted me with IRC and he was asking ffmpeg team is looking for people who can help them organize an event in Seoul and they are looking for a free venue

unfortunately I lost IRC logs so I don't remember whole conversation

## Journey to find a venue
So I could connected with one of the person from ffmpeg team, Lynne. She is also amazing developer.

She gave me a contact of VideoLan People.

And I told them I will try find some venues and I tried to contact as many places I can try but all of places denied our request because I was nobody

And the event dates were weekend, Saturday and Sunday

and then I realised one of classes I took at the uni is photo editing and we used GIMP for that and I couldnt believe why I didn't contact to the professor

## Long wait

## Another mission!
